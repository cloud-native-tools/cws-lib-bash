# TODO List for CWS-Lib-Bash

## Bash Completion Integration

- [ ] **Fix bash completion conflict** - `bin/cws_setup:29`
  - Currently disabling bash completion to avoid conflicts with cws_lib
  - Need to find a better solution that allows both to coexist
  - Current workaround: backs up `/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh`

## Priority Items

1. **Medium Priority**: Resolve bash completion conflicts without disabling system feature

## Implementation Notes

- The current solution is a temporary workaround
- Need to investigate proper integration approach
- Should maintain system bash completion functionality while adding cws_lib features
