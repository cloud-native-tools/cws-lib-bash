# Implementation Plan: [SPEC]

**Branch**: `[###-spec-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Specification from `.specify/specs/[###-spec-name]/requirements.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Core Principles Compliance**:

- **Specification-Driven Development**: Code serves specifications; specifications are executable and generate working systems
- **Feature-Centric Development**: Feature Index is single source of truth; all phases re-evaluate Feature changes
- **Intent-Driven Development**: Focus on "what" and "why" before "how"; use rich specifications with guardrails
- **Test-First & Contract-Driven**: TDD flow followed; pure functions have unit tests; critical flows have regression coverage
- **AI Agent Integration**: Only approved agents (GitHub Copilot, Qwen Code, opencode); configuration rejects unsupported providers
- **Continuous Quality & Observability**: Structured logging; semantic versioning; CI quality gates; simple designs (YAGNI)
- **SDD Workflow Compliance**: Follow spec → plan → tasks → implement workflow with proper validation at each phase

**Gates Status**: [✅ All gates pass / ❌ Specific gate failures with justification]

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**
> If no violations, explicitly write "N/A" and remove the table.

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
