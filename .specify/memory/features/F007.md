## Replacement Rules

1. No placeholder token may remain after instantiation.  
2. Dates must be valid ISO format.  
3. Keep lists dense; remove unused trailing placeholder lines.  
4. Preserve this heading structure; do not add unrelated sections.  
5. Always update `Feature Index` after creating or modifying a feature detail file.
